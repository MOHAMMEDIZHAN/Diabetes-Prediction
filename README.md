Introduction:
In this project, we aim to predict the likelihood of a person being diabetic based on various health parameters. This prediction is crucial for early diagnosis and management of diabetes, which can significantly improve a patient's quality of life.

Workflow:

1. Data Collection:
Collecting diabetes data, which includes various health parameters of individuals.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Analyzing and preprocessing the data to gather insights and prepare it for the machine learning model.

3. Train-Test Split:
Splitting the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

4. Support Vector Machine Model:
Training an SVM model on the training data to determine whether a person is diabetic or not.

5. Trained Support Vector Machine Model:
Using the trained SVM model to predict whether a new data point represents a diabetic or non-diabetic individual.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. It consists of several health parameters such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, age, and more.

Installation:
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a requirements.txt file with the following contents:

Copy code
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Usage

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/MOHAMMEDIZHAN/Diabetes-Prediction.git
cd Diabetes-Prediction

Run the Script:
python DiabetesPrediction.ipynb

Results:
The SVM model will output the accuracy of its predictions on the test data. Additionally, it will predict whether a new input represents a diabetic or non-diabetic individual.
